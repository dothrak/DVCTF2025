You have been found by the OCBC (Office central de lutte contre le trafic des biens culturels - Central Office for Combating Trafficking in Cultural Property). To guarantee your freedom, you must cooperate: if you manage to provide all the information relating to the investigation, no charges will be brought against you.

We have identified that the following works will be attempting to be stolen shortly:

- Les trois dames de Gand
- Dame à sa toilette (Codde, Pieter Jacobsz)
- Le Lion de Florence (Monsiau, Nicolas André)

Your mission is to find the name of the AILE in which the items are stored, as well as their main inventory number.

The flag is in the form: DVCTF{AILE-1_RF-1_AILE-2_RF-2_AILE3_RF-3}.

Example:

- Work 1 in the DaVinci AILE with RF number 123
- Work 2 in the Leonardo AILE with an RF number 456 789
- Work 1 in the Mona Lisa AILE with an RF number of 1011
